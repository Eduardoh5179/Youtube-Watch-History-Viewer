# YouTube Watch History Viewer

YouTube Watch History Viewer is a tool to help users to track their recently watched videos on YouTube and have a backup of their accounts in a versatile and organized way. It uses downloadable data from **Google Takeout**, where users can export their data. Since there isn't a pratical way to view those files, this web application offers a solution.

## üìñ How to use it?

- Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
- Uncheck everything except the YouTube option
