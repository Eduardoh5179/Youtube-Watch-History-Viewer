# Youtube Watch History Viewer

YouTube Watch History Viewer is a tool to help users to track their recently watched videos on Youtube and have a backup of their accounts in a versatile and organized way. It uses downloadable data from Google Takeout, where users can export their data. Since there isn't a pratical way to view those files, this web application offers a solution.

## üìñ How to use it?

- Go to GoogleTakeout.com
- Uncheck everything except the YouTube option
- Under **Watch History** option choose the .json format
- Customize YouTube export settings
- Download the compressed folder containing the data
- Unzip it and locate the **watch history .json file**
- Open this application and upload the file
- If everything works correctly, you'll see your watch history and your most recent watched videos

## üîç Why use it?

YouTube's watch history can sometimes be deleted due to automatic deletions, bugs, or other issues. By keeping an active backup you can prevent eventual losses.
